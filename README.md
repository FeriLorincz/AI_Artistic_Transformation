## 🎨 Project Overview

This project leverages artificial intelligence to transform ordinary photographs into artistic watercolor and ink sketches, providing inspiration for artists and creative enthusiasts. By bridging technology and art, it offers a unique tool for creative exploration.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Photo-to-Sketch Conversion**: Transform any photo into an artistic sketch with a single tap
- **Watercolor Style**: Get results that mimic traditional watercolor and ink techniques
- **Mobile Convenience**: Capture and transform images directly on your Android device
- **Creative Inspiration**: Use the generated sketches as a starting point for your own artwork

## 🧠 Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, Google Colab
- **Image Processing**: Custom neural style transfer techniques
- **Mobile Development**: Java, Android Studio
- **Training Data**: Curated dataset of photographs and artistic sketches

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/FeriLorincz/AI_Artistic_Transformation.git
   ```

2. **Explore the AI Model**
   - Navigate to the `model` directory
   - Open the Python script in Google Colab to experiment with the transformation process

3. **Run the Android Application**
   - Open the `android` directory in Android Studio
   - Build and run the application on your device or emulator

### For Artists and Creative Users

The Android application allows you to:
- Take photos of buildings, landscapes, or objects
- Transform them into watercolor-style sketches instantly
- Save and share your artistic transformations
- Use the results as underlays or inspiration for your own artwork

## 🔮 Current Limitations & Future Improvements

- **Style Consistency**: The current model produces varied results based on input quality
- **Processing Speed**: Future updates will optimize for faster transformations
- **Style Options**: Plans to add more artistic styles beyond watercolor
- **Resolution Enhancement**: Working on improving the detail in the output sketches
